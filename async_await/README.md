# Async Await


This simple program does a GET request to an api and is meant to show how to implement it in the async await fashion typical in javascript/typescript.

It uses the [tokio] crate and also the [anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/) and [thiserror](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) crates for debugging and error handling.
