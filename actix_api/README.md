## Actix API

This is a simple API that uses Actix Web to handle HTTP requests.
It uses the Rhai scripting engine to perform mathematical operations.

It supports the following operations:

- Multiply
- Add
- Subtract
- Divide
- Exponent


The original project only had add and subtract, I did an extension by adding the other
three operations.
