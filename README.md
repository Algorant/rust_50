# 50 Projects in Rust

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-Rust-informational

This is a collection of 50 rust projects based on the Youtube Playlist by [Akhil Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5dTjWUk_cPYuhHm9_QImW7_u4lr5d6zO).

I make slight deviations and improvements to my liking as I go along. Eventually I deviate completely when there are projects that I am not interested in (such as the Solana and Ethereum-related projects, I'm really only interested in Bitcoin).

The ones that are completely new are annotated.

## Here is the list:

1. [compress](./compress) - Takes in a file and compresses it using [flake2](https://docs.rs/flate2/latest/flate2/).
2. [decompress](./decompress/) - Takes in a zip file and decompresses it.
3. [read_csv](./read_csv/) - Reads csv and outputs to stdout.
4. [read_json](./read_json/) - Reads in JSON using [serde](https://serde.rs/).
5. [write_json](./write_json) - Writes JSON to stdout using [serde](https://serde.rs/).
